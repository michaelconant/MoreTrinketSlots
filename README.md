## Future Update Ideas
Some ideas I have for future updates include:
- add the ability to change the player's initial trinket size 4
- include a configurable file that will allow the user to easily change how many trinket slots each item gives
	- this will allow the user easily increase the max trinket size to any size they want
- create items for all the original bosses that don't have trinket items inorde to make it simplier to edit in the future
	- this paired with a configurable file would give the user the ability to change which bosses drop inventory slot items
- chat commands to configure the mod
